Use javac to compile the program.
User will be prompted with choice of either performing a* with a 
random array or with a user specified array.
User is then prompted with which heuristic to use to perform a*
User is then prompted with which data structure to use either tree or graph.
The search is then performed and the path to the goal is printed
as well as the depth of the data structure.

Included in the zip is the results of various tests
with each file being named based on what was performed 
ex: graphAStarTestH2 was 500 tests on random arrays using
graph and heuristic 2.
The files with time in their name are simply the same tests
but with only the runtime of the algorith in nano seconds.
